                    Bhopal district was carved out of the erstwhile Sehore District of Bhopal division vide M.P.Govt.
                    Notification No.2477/1977/Sa/One/ dated 13th September, 1972.The district derives its name from the
                    district head-quarters town Bhopal which is also the capital of Madhya Pradesh. The etymology of the
                    term Bhopal has been derived from its former name Bhojpal as would be evident form the following
                    extract from the imperial Gazetter of Central India,1908 P.240.

                    “The name (Bhopal) is popularly derived from Bhojpal or Bhoj’s dam, the great dam which now holds up
                    the Bhopal city lakes, and is said to have been built by a Minister of Raja Bhoj,the Parmar ruler of
                    Dhar. The still greater work which formerly held up the Tal (lake) being attributed to this monarch
                    himself. The name is, however, invariably pronounced, Bhupal and Dr. Fleet considers it to be
                    derived simply from Bhupala, a King, the popular derivation being an instance of the striving after
                    a meaning so common in such cases.”
